# Football Analysis and Prediction Project

This project focuses on football analysis and prediction using data scraping techniques to gather comprehensive data from various websites for five seasons. The collected data comprises over 150 features, covering key aspects such as possession, passing, pass types, goal creation actions, goalkeeping, and defense. 

## Project Files

1. **laliga_matches.csv**: This file contains the raw data used for analysis and prediction. It includes detailed information about matches from La Liga for the five seasons.
2. **Prediction and Analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and match outcome prediction. It uses machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Additionally, a hybrid model combining XGBoost with SVM is implemented for enhanced predictive capabilities.
3. **Web Scraping.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for web scraping techniques used to gather the necessary data from various websites. It demonstrates how data was collected and stored in the `laliga_matches.csv` file.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to analyze and predict football match outcomes based on the provided data. The project follows the following steps:

1. Data Collection: The `Web Scraping.ipynb` notebook explains the data scraping techniques used to gather comprehensive data from various websites. The collected data is stored in the `laliga_matches.csv` file.

2. Data Preprocessing: The `Prediction and Analysis.ipynb` notebook performs data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.

3. Feature Selection: To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis, a feature selection process is applied to identify the most relevant features within each category.

4. Model Training: Five different models, namely SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, are trained using the selected features. These models learn patterns and relationships in the data to predict match outcomes.

5. Hybrid Model Construction: A hybrid model is constructed by combining the XGBoost algorithm with the SVM model. This hybrid model demonstrates enhanced predictive capabilities for future football predictions.

6. Prediction and Analysis: Using the trained models, match outcomes for the latest season of La Liga are predicted. The points table for the season is calculated, providing valuable insights into the performance of teams based on the analyzed features.

7. Future Extensions: In addition to match outcome predictions, this project explores the potential for extending the models to incorporate other valuable metrics, such as player performance analysis, team formations, and tactical insights.
